# Computer Algorithms and Modelling

An application written for the Computer Algorithms and Modelling course in year 2 of university.

## Description

Created to demonstrate the use of Dijkstra's algorithm for path traversal, I created a component system using the 
`java.awt` Graphics classes.

## Side note

I've added this to Github because I've recently started developing in an application that does not have access to any Swing components.
Many classes were created to fix multiple issues with this exact problem. (Double buffering... etc)
